# Filip Visuals
This is my first project.
FilipViusals is a website that I made during my mentorship period at RankingCoach.
In this project I used React on the front-end and PHP Symfony on the back-end.
The site is made for the relationship between the photographer and the client, with the aim of making the photographer's work easier and making it more accessible for the client to view the images
